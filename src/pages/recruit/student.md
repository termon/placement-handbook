## Confirm Placement Offer

Once you have been offered a placement post you need to log the offer on the Recruit System to have it reviewed and approved.

### Approved Post

If you applied for the post via Handshake, then it will be recorded in your list of applications on Recruit.

Navigate to **Year Long Placements**, then **Applications**, then **External Applications**

Then select the application you have been offered and click the **Confirm Offer** link.

>⚠️ **NOTE** You will only receive this email when your placement been approved

## Starting Placement

Over the placement year you are working towards achievement of a Diploma in Professional Practice (DPP/DPP(I)).

As part of your assessment during the placement year, you will have a number of submissions to carry out. These include:

    - [x] completion of placement details and health and safety forms
    - [x] completion and signing of a learning agreement
    - [x] completion and signing of an employer indemnity form
    - [x] maintenance of a placement journal
    - [x] completion of paperwork relating to placement visits
    - [x] submission of a final placement report.

### Placement Details

You need to firstly confirm details regarding your placement that will be required by your placement tutor and academic supervisor during the placement, (company details, supervisor details, contact details, title of role, start-end dates etc) and revise accordingly

### Health and Safety

Your safety whilst on placement is of paramount importance and thus it is essential that you complete the ‘Health & Safety’ assessment form. In the case where an employer does not provide any H&S induction or training, this should be discussed with the employer and also with the academic placement visitor at the first placement visit.

>⚠️  **NOTE:** Recruit will send reminder emails to students, until these actions are completed.

### *Learning agreement - TBC*

You will complete the Learning Agreement Template (accessible via placement downloads - see below) and upload to Recruit.

### Placement Downloads

During the placement the student may be directed to various placement related documents. These are available in the Downloads section and examples are shown below.

>⚠️ **Note:** the files available in downloads will vary from year to year and the list below is for demonstration purposes only

### Placement Journal

The Placement Journal provides a record of the experiences that you have gained and the learning that you have achieved.  It will be a valuable resource for you in the preparation of your Placement Report. It will be inspected by your Academic Visitor at each visit, and by the assessor of your Placement Report.

To access the journal, under ‘Year Long Placements’ select ‘Submissions’, then click the ‘Placement Journal’ button.

#### Journal listing

Use a simple week number /date system to organise entries. Note the journal entries here are simply test data and not reflective of what a normal entry should contain. You can edit/delete a journal entry for up to 24 hours to correct mistakes. Refer to the placement handbook for guidance on journal entries.

New journal entries can be added by clicking the Journal Entry button and then filling in the form shown below

## Placement Visits

You can normally expect to be visited twice during your placement. The first visit will take place around November/December and the second visit around March/April. These dates may vary slightly depending on when your placement started.

>⚠️ **NOTE** You must regularly check your University email account for communications from the placement team and your academic visitor and respond in a timely manner.

At a visit, your academic visitor will normally:

- Review your placement journal and placement work summary
- Discuss your work and progress
- Listen to any issues highlighted and attempt to resolve where possible
- Discuss your performance with your line manager and any issues highlighed
- Assess your achievement of the Placement Competencies
- Give you feedback on your performance and progress

### Scheduled Visit

Once an academic visitor has scheduled a placement visit on Recruit, the student and the industrial supervisor are automatically emailed (email includes a calendar ICS file attachment).

![img](/recruit/student/5-visit-1.png)

### Placement Work Summary

The student should then upload the Placement Work Summary Form at least 48 hours before your first placement visit. Note the option to upload the form is not available until the academic supervisor schedules the visit **via Recruit**. If the upload does not appear then contact your academic supervisor and ask them to schedule the visit in Recruit.

The Placement Work Summary Form template is available in the [downloads](/6-student-guidance/#placement-downloads) section.

You can upload this document as often as required (over writing the original), up until the academic has submitted visit feedback and at which point the document can no longer be uploaded.

![img](/recruit/student/5-visit-2.png)

### Visit Feedback

Once the visit has been completed the academic will upload their visit feedback and the student will receive and email alerting them to the fact that the feedback is now available.

![img](/recruit/student/5-visit-3.png)

When you log in again you can no longer upload the First Visit Submission and instead can click the Visit view botton to review the feedback provided.

![img](/recruit/student/5-visit-4.png)

You should reflect, in your Placement Journal, upon any feedback you have been given.

## Final Report

In semester 2 (typically around the second placement visit) students will be contacted by email and provided with instructions regarding submission of the final placement report. A template for the report will be provided via email and/or via the Recruit [downloads](/6-student-guidance/#placement-downloads) area.

### Upload Report

 To upload the report select the `Upload Placement Report` button in the Submissions section.

![img](/recruit/student/6-report-1.png)

Then upload the report (in pdf format). As noted, you should not upload the report until informed by the Placement Tutor. Typically report notifications are send out around late April, with report submissions to be made by end of May.

### Feedback

As per placement visit submissions, once the final report submission has been assessed/feedback provided, it can no longer be uploaded.

>⚠️ **NOTE** Once report has been assessed the feedback is only visible in Recruit from 1st October.
